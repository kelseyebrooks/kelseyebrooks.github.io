<p>I'm Kelsey Brooks a freshman at the University of Maine, Orono studying business. I'm 18 years old, from a small town in the Mid-Coast, Cushing, Maine. Out of my family I am the youngest of four daughters but the middle out of my whole entire family. I have a pretty large family, growing up pretty close with all my cousins. Grew up playing sports, hanging out with friends, and going on family trips.</p>
