<p> I started playing sports at a very young age. Growing up, my dad was my basketball and soccer coach from elementary school to sixth grade. Of course having him there to motivate me and never let me give up made me develop a huge love for sports. I've won countless amount of championships whether it being 3rd and 4th grade soccer championship to KVAC Class B Northern Regional Championships in both soccer and lacrosse.</p> <p> I remember just having so much fun and never wanting to stop playing. I did several summer and winter clinics through the years, all the way up through highschool. My junior year in highschool I was chosen as the KVAC Class B Player of the Year, probably my biggest accomplishment in highschool. I am not playing for the college, however, I am excited to get started with intermerals. </p>Next sport was basketball, same coach, my dad and his friend who pushed us to make sure we would win every championship in elementary school in all the leagues we played in. My basketball career came to end an sophomore year in high school, I decided I no longer wanted to play, but would much rather just support both the boys and girls teams. </p> <p>Lacrosse came into play my freshman year in highschool, but didn't take long before it was one of my favorite sports. I started with summer camps and clinics then soon became a starter on the varsity team as a freshman. The year I joined was the first year that my schools lacrosse team was considered a varsity sport because it had to be a club sport for four years prior. We had lots of success as a team throughout my years making it to the KVAC game three out of my four years, semi-finals once, and playoffs every year. Lacrosse will forever be a game I want to play and just enjoy myself while doing so.</p> <p> Playing all these sports just made my life almost revolve around them having no time except for school and sports, but I did not mind that one bit. I loved sports and still love them and will always enjoy playing them as I get older. </p>
