<p>Growing up I rode four-wheelers, dirt bikes, bikes, snowmobiles, any thing with wheels on it. I loved and still do love the outdoors and all the freedom I have around our house. It et me explore the outdoors to an extent that most kids aren't able to do. Living in the little town of Cushing I live close to all my family. My moms sister, my aunt, lived right up the road, my grandmother lived down the river from us, other aunts, uncles, and cousins lived no longer than 15 minutes away.</p> <p>Along with riding automobiles, I played sports all of my childhood, loves playing Bratz and with babies, coloring the driveway with chalk, and camping at my favorite local campground.</p> <p>I had a childhood yellow lab named Duncan, he was the sweetest dog ever but he passed when he was 15 years old. Along with him we had two cats, the died, now we have two more, we went through countless amount of chickens, roosters, and guinea hens, now was have a bunny, Trixie, that my dad surprised us with two Easters ago.</p><p> Being the youngest child and girl in the family I was fortanite to have good role models. Yet, my oldest sister Hayley who is now 24 was so mean to me as a child because she was the "boss" I am now thankful how she broughtmeup in a sense. Erika was and will always be the person I look up to the most, she is my second oldest siter who is now 23. Jillian, my twin sister, identical twin sister was enemy growing up. Yes we played together but we fought about everything, as we've gotten older it's gotten better though. </p> <p>My dad, his brother, and his sister all own the Brooks Trap Mill. With him being the CEO of that and living in a house full of girls, he was often working or just spending time there. Going there a lot had me develop quite strong relationships with all the workers, plus working there on vacations, to this day I enjoy walking into that environment and being able to just have anice conversation will all the employees. Plus, a lot of them have seen me grow up from a little kid, to now being in college.</p><p>Being raised this way has made me the way I am and I couldn't be more fortunate for my family and relatives and all the opportunites that have been given to me.</p>
