<p>I went to PenBay Christian School for preschool and that was a two year program. That's where I met my childhood and current best friend who lived right across the road from me. After graduating there I went to Cushing Community School kindergarden to 4th grade. I loved each and everyone of my teachers and my class only had give or take 15 kids. Going to Thomaston Grammar School was a big step for my class and I because that meant combining with the neighboring town. I attended 5th grade to 7th grade there then moved to Oceanside West for 8th and 9th grade. When I was in middle school we combined with another district therefor we didn't have enough room in one highschool so we had to go to 9th grade in a different school. After Oceanside West, I finished my highschool career at Oceanside East and now attending the University of Maine, Orono in hopes to graduate with my bachelors degree in business. </p>
